# Chat Application

This program is an chat application. It is designed using Socket Programming. The program consists of two parts, server and client. By establishing a connection with the client server, it is used to transfer the messages of the user to the server and at the same time to receive these messages from the server.

### About Socket Programming

Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.

### Where is Socket Used?

A Unix Socket is used in a client-server application framework. A server is a process that performs some functions on request from a client. Most of the application-level protocols like FTP, SMTP, and POP3 make use of sockets to establish connection between client and server and then for exchanging data.
